    <h1>the masterplan</h1>
    <p>Take the time to make some sense<br>
    Of what you want to say<br>
    And cast your words away upon the waves</p>
    <p>Sail them home with Acquiesce<br>
    On a ship of hope today<br>
    And as they land upon the shore<br>
    Tell them not to fear no more<br>
    Say it loud and sing it proud today</p>
    <p>And then<br>
    Dance if you wanna dance<br>
    Please brother take a chance<br>
    You know they're gonna go<br>
    Which way they wanna go<br>
    All we know is that we don't know<br>
    How it's gonna be<br>
    Please brother let it be<br>
    Life on the other hand won't make us understand<br>
    We're all part of the masterplan</p>
