    <h1>underneath the sky</h1>
    <p>Underneath the sky of red<br>
    Is a storyteller sleeping alone<br>
    He has no face and he has no name<br>
    And his whereabouts are sort of unknown</p>
    
    <p>All he needs is his life in a suitcase<br>
    It belongs to a friend of a friend<br>
    And as we drink to ourselves<br>
    We'll amuse ourselves<br>
    Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again<br>
    Underneath the sky again</p>
    
    
    <p>So wish me away to an unknown place<br>
    Am I living in a land with no name<br>
    I'll be making a start with my brand new heart<br>
    Stop me making sense once again</p>
    
    <p>All we need is our lives in a suitcase<br>
    They belong to a friend of a friend's<br>
    And as we drink to ourselves<br>
    We'll amuse ourselves<br>
    Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again<br>
    Underneath the sky again</p>
    
    <p>They belong to a friend of a friend's<br>
    And as we drink to ourselves<br>
    We'll amuse ourselves<br>
    Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again<br>
    Underneath the sky again<br>
    Underneath the sky again<br>
    Underneath the sky again<br>
    Underneath the sky again<br>
    Again, again<br>
    Underneath the sky again</p>
