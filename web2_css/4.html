      <h2 style="text-align:center">underneath the sky</h2>
      <p>Underneath the sky of red<br>
      Is a storyteller sleeping alone<br>
      He has no face and he has no name<br>
      And his whereabouts are sort of unknown</p>
      
      <p>All he needs is his life in a suitcase<br>
      It belongs to a friend of a friend<br>
      And as we drink to ourselves<br>
      We'll amuse ourselves<br>
      Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again<br>
      Underneath the sky again</p>
      
      
      <p>So wish me away to an unknown place<br>
      Am I living in a land with no name<br>
      I'll be making a start with my brand new heart<br>
      Stop me making sense once again</p>
      
      <p>All we need is our lives in a suitcase<br>
      They belong to a friend of a friend's<br>
      And as we drink to ourselves<br>
      We'll amuse ourselves<br>
      Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again<br>
      Underneath the sky again</p>
      
      <p>They belong to a friend of a friend's<br>
      And as we drink to ourselves<br>
      We'll amuse ourselves<br>
      Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again<br>
      Underneath the sky again<br>
      Underneath the sky again<br>
      Underneath the sky again<br>
      Underneath the sky again<br>
      Again, again<br>
      Underneath the sky again</p>
