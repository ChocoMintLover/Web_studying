    <p>There's no need for you to say you're sorry<br>
    Goodbye, I'm going home<br>
    I don't care no more, so don't you worry<br>
    Goodbye, I'm going home</p>
    <p>I hate the way that even though you know you're worng<br>
    You say you're right<br>
    I hate the books you read and all your friends<br>
    Your music's shite, it keeps me up all night, up all night</p>
    <p>There's no need for you to say you're sorry<br>
    Goodbye, I'm going home<br>
    I don't care no more, so don't you worry<br>
    Goodbye, I'm going home</p>
    <p>hate the way that you are so sarcastic<br>
    And you're not very bright<br>
    You think that everything you've done's fantastic<br>
    Your music's shite, it keeps me up all night, up all night</p>
    <p>And it will be nice to be alone<br>
    For a week or two<br>
    But I know then I will be right<br>
    Right back here with you, with you<br>
    With you, with you, with you, with you, with you</p>
    <p>There's no need for you to say you're sorry<br>
    Goodbye, I'm going home<br>
    I don't care no more, so don't you worry<br>
    Goodbye, I'm going home</p>
