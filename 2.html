    <h2>roll with it</h2>
    <p>You gotta roll with it<br>
    You gotta take your time<br>
    You gotta say what you say<br>
    Don't let anybody get in your way<br>
    'Cause it's all too much for me to take</p>
    <p>Don't ever stand aside<br>
    Don't ever be denied<br>
    You wanna be who you'd be<br>
    If you're coming with me<br>
    I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside<br>
    I think I'm gonna take me away and hide</p>
    <p>I'm thinking of things that I just can't abide<br>
    I know the roads down which your life will drive (life will drive)<br>
    I find the key that lets you slip inside (slip inside)<br>
    Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door (behind the door)<br>
    But you know I think I recognize your face<br>
    But I've never seen you before</p>
