      <p>There's no need for you to say you're sorry<br>
      Goodbye, I'm going home<br>
      I don't care no more, so don't you worry<br>
      Goodbye, I'm going home</p>
      <p>I hate the way that even though you know you're worng<br>
      You say you're right<br>
      I hate the books you read and all your friends<br>
      Your music's shite, it keeps me up all night, up all night</p>
      <p>There's no need for you to say you're sorry<br>
      Goodbye, I'm going home<br>
      I don't care no more, so don't you worry<br>
      Goodbye, I'm going home</p>
      <p>hate the way that you are so sarcastic<br>
      And you're not very bright<br>
      You think that everything you've done's fantastic<br>
      Your music's shite, it keeps me up all night, up all night</p>
      <p>And it will be nice to be alone<br>
      For a week or two<br>
      But I know then I will be right<br>
      Right back here with you, with you<br>
      With you, with you, with you, with you, with you</p>
      <p>There's no need for you to say you're sorry<br>
      Goodbye, I'm going home<br>
      I don't care no more, so don't you worry<br>
      Goodbye, I'm going home</p>
